# We Pot Plants

Thanks to [We Pot Plants][wepotplants], I was introduced to plant varieties that I hadn't even known existed. Syngonium with its delicate leaves, alocasia with its dramatic presence, the trailing beauty of a philodendron, and the iconic monstera - each plant brought its own unique charm into my growing indoor jungle.

 I kept searching for small businesses like [Tea Time Succulents][teatime], [From Desert to Jungle][desert], [Indoor Farmer][farmer], and even [Living Junglee][netherlands] all the way from the Netherlands. I've not only bought a variety of plants from these places but also stocked up on essentials like pots, supports, fertilizers, and home decor. Additionally, I've started my own little plant-focused [Instagram][me] to share my passion.
